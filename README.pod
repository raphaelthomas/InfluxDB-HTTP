=head1 NAME

InfluxDB::HTTP - The Perl way to interact with InfluxDB!

=head1 VERSION

Version 0.04

=head1 SYNOPSIS

InfluxDB::HTTP allows you to interact with the InfluxDB HTTP API. The module essentially provides
one method per InfluxDB HTTP API endpoint, that is C<ping>, C<write> and C<query>.

    use InfluxDB::HTTP;

    my $influx = InfluxDB::HTTP->new();

    my $ping_result = $influx->ping();
    print "$ping_result\n";

    my $query = $influx->query(
        [ 'SELECT Lookups FROM _internal.monitor.runtime WHERE time > '.(time - 60)*1000000000, 'SHOW DATABASES'],
        epoch => 's',
    );

    print "$query\n";


=head1 SUBROUTINES/METHODS

=head2 RETURN VALUES AND ERROR HANDLING

C<Object::Result> is relied upon for returning data from subroutines. The respective result
object can always be used as string and evaluated on a boolean basis. A result object
evaluating to false indicates an error and a corresponding error message is provided in the
attribute C<error>:

    my $ping = $influx->ping();
    print $ping->error unless ($ping);

Furthermore, all result objects provide access to the C<HTTP::Response> object that is returned
by InfluxDB in the attribute C<raw>.

=head2 new(host=>'localhost', port=>8086, username=>'zutana', password=>'se¢retØ', ssl=>1, ssl_verify=>0, ssl_opts=>{}, timeout=>600)

Passing C<host>, C<port>, C<username>, C<password>, C<ssl>, C<ssl_verify>, C<ssl_opts>, and/or 
C<timeout> is optional, defaulting to the InfluxDB defaults or to 3 minutes for the timeout. 
The timeout is in seconds.

Returns an instance of InfluxDB::HTTP.

=head2 ping()

Pings the InfluxDB instance configured in the constructor (i.e. by C<host> and C<port>).

Returned object evaluates to true or false depending on whether the ping was successful or not.
If true, then it contains a C<version> attribute that indicates the InfluxDB version running on
the pinged server.

The C<version> attribute is extracted from the C<X-Influxdb-Version> HTTP response header, which
is part of the HTTP response from the pinged InfluxDB instance.

    my $ping = $influx->ping();
    print $ping->version if ($ping);

=head2 query(query, database=>"DATABASE", chunk_size=>CHUNK_SIZE, epoch=>"ns")

Used to query the InfluxDB instance. All parameters but the first one are optional. The
C<query> parameter can either be a String or a Perl ArrayRef of Strings, where every String
contains a valid InfluxDB query.

If the returned object evaluates to true, indicating that the query was successful, then
the returned object's C<data> attribute contains the entire response from InfluxDB as Perl
hash. Additionally the attribute C<request_id> provides the request identifier as set in
the HTTP reponse headers by InfluxDB. This can for example be useful for correlating
requests with log files.

=head2 write(data, database=>"DATABASE", precision=>"ns", retention_policy=>"RP", measurement=>"foo", tag_fields=>("tag1", ...))

Writes data into InfluxDB. The 1ˢᵗ parameter C<data> can either be a String or an
ArrayRef of Strings or Hashes, where each String contains one valid InfluxDB LineProtocol
statement and each Hash represents a point. All of those mesaurements are then sent to 
InfluxDB and the specified database. The returned object evaluates to true if the 
write was successful, and otherwise to false.

The optional argument "C<precision>" can be given if a precsion different than "ns" is used in
the line protocol. InfluxDB docs suggest that using a coarser precision than ns can save
space and processing. In many cases "s" or "m" might do.

The optional argument "C<retention_policy>" can be used to specify a retention policy other than
the default retention policy of the selected database.

The optional argument "C<measurement>" is required if the 1ˢᵗ parameter C<data> is an ArrayRef 
and contains elements other than Strings.

The optional argument "C<tag_fields>" specifies which field(s) will be stored as tag(s).

=head2 get_lwp_useragent

Returns the internally used LWP::UserAgent instance for possible modifications
(e.g. to configure an HTTP proxy).
